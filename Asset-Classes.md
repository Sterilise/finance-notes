# Introduction
**Asset Classes are groups of assets with similar characteristics,
the key asset classes are:**

* Equities
* Bonds
* Cash & cash equivalents
* Real estate
* Alternative assets

## Asset class types

### Equity 
An **equity security** represents **ownership interest in an issuer**, equities can take the form of **common or preferred stock**. E.g. a equity security issued by apple would represent an ownership interest in apple.  

### Bonds

Bonds are mainly **issued by governments, public entities, and coporates**, and typically pay a **fixed or floating rate coupon**. Where the coupon represents the principle on the bond.

### Cash and Cash Equivalents

* Treasury bills - A Treasury Bill (T-Bill) is a short-term U.S. government debt obligation backed by the Treasury Department with a maturity of one year or less. Treasury bills are usually sold in denominations of $1,000. However, some can reach a maximum denomination of $5 million in non-competitive bids. These securities are widely regarded as low-risk and secure investments. The Treasury Department sells T-Bills during auctions using a competitive and non-competitive bidding process. Noncompetitive bids—also known as non-competitive tenders—have a price based on the average of all the competitive bids received. T-Bills tend to have a high tangible net worth.
* CDs (Certificate of Deposit) - A certificate of deposit (CD) is a document issued by the bank to an investor who chooses to deposit his funds in the bank for a specific amount of time. A certificate of deposit can also be referred to as a promissory note issued by a bank. One feature of the CD is that once the money has been deposited for a period of time the depositor cannot withdraw the funds without incurring a penalty for early withdrawal. Since funds cannot be withdrawn as pleased, the interest paid to the depositor of a CD is higher than for a savings account. Once the CD matures, at the end of the specified term of holding the funds are repaid to the depositor alongside the interest calculated for the period. CDs issued by banks can be negotiable or non-negotiable. A negotiable CD allows the holder to sell it on the money market before maturity. A non-negotiable CD mandates the depositor hold the funds till maturity or incur a penalty for early withdrawal.
* CP (Commercial Paper) - Commercial paper is a short term money market instrument that matures within a period of 270 days. Commercial papers are used as a means of raising funds, sometimes used instead of a bank loan, and are usually preferred over a bank loan since large amounts of funds can be raised within a short period of time. Commercial papers are not backed by collateral and, therefore, only creditworthy institutions with high debt ratings can issue them to obtain funds at a lower cost of interest. If the organization does not have a very attractive debt rating they may have to offer a high interest rate that covers investment risk, to attract investors to invest. An advantage to the issuer of a commercial paper is that since the instrument has a very short maturity it does not require a registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which makes it much less complicated and a cheaper form of obtaining finance.

### Real Estate

Real estate can take the form of commercial and residential property. Investors can invest in real estate directly of REITs (Real estate investment trusts). 

* Real estate investment trusts - A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate.
    Modeled after mutual funds, REITs pool the capital of numerous investors. This makes it possible for individual investors to earn dividends from real estate investments—without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves.

### Alternatives

Alternatives include:
* Commodities - A commodity is a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type. Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services. The quality of a given commodity may differ slightly, but it is essentially uniform across producers. When they are traded on an exchange, commodities must also meet specified minimum standards, also known as a basis grade. Examples would be oil, gas, corn, gold.
* Currencies - Currency is a medium of exchange for goods and services. In short, it's money, in the form of paper or coins, usually issued by a government and generally accepted at its face value as a method of payment. Generally currencies are fiat, fiat money is backed by a country's government instead of a physical commodity or financial instrument
* Hedge Funds - Hedge funds are actively managed investment pools whose managers use a wide range of strategies, often including buying with borrowed money and trading esoteric assets, in an effort to beat average investment returns for their clients. They are considered risky alternative investment choices.
* Private Equity - Private equity is an alternative investment class and consists of capital that is not listed on a public exchange. Private equity is composed of funds and investors that directly invest in private companies, or that engage in buyouts of public companies, resulting in the delisting of public equity. Institutional and retail investors provide the capital for private equity, and the capital can be utilized to fund new technology, make acquisitions, expand working capital, and bolster and solidify a balance sheet
* Art & Collectibles - A collectible refers to an item worth far more than it was initially sold for because of its rarity and/or popularity. The price for a particular collectible usually depends on how many of the same items are available and its overall condition.

# Equities

**Equities** are **financial securities** that give holders some degree of **ownership in underlying entities/companies**. There are two main types of equity security: **common stock and preferred stock**.

**Instrument** - An **instrument is a means by which something of value is transferred, held, or accomplished**. In the **field of finance, an instrument is a tradable asset, or a negotiable item, such as a security, commodity, derivative, or index, or any item that underlies a derivative**. In separate contexts, an instrument can alternatively refer to an economic variable that can be controlled or altered by government policymakers to effect a change in other economic indicators. It can also refer to a legal document such as a contract, will, or deed.

**Security** - The term **"security" refers to a fungible (can be mutually interchanged), negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value. It represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded corporation via stock; a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation represented by owning that entity's bond; or rights to ownership as represented by an option**.

## Common Stock

Most equities take the form of **common stock (or "ordinary shares") that give owners some degree of ownership in a company**. **Common stock grants shareholders voting rights at AGMs - different classes of common stock may carry different voting rights**. Shareholders may have pre-emption rights whereby a company cannot issue shares to new shareholders without offering them first to existing shareholders. 

The underlying health of a company will dictate the value of a share - if the company is profitable, then shareholders benefit from either cash dividends or capital appreciation. If the company fares poorly, it may be unable to pay a dividend. **Note that dividends are arbitrary rather than mandatory - company management may decide to retain earninings in the company (even where it is profitable) rather than pay dividends to common stockholders**. **Dividend policies vary radically across the world's largest companies**. **In the case of company bankruptcy, equity holders are the last in line to receive any liquidation proceeds** - they usually receive nothing.

**Bankruptcy** - **Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding involving a person or business that is unable to repay their outstanding debts**. The bankruptcy **process begins with a petition filed by the debtor, which is most common, or on behalf of creditors, which is less common**. All of the **debtor's assets are measured and evaluated**, and the **assets may be used to repay a portion of the outstanding debt**.

## Preferred Stock

Companies sometimes issue securities known as **preferred stock** (or preference shares). Preferred stock carries a **fixed dividend that must be paid to preferred stockholders before ordinary shareholders receive anything**. It represents a "middle layer" in the capital structure of an organization (between debt and equity). **In the event of liquidation, preferred stockholders receive any residual value ahead of ordinary shareholders, but after bondholders or bank creditors**.

The investment characteristics of preferred stock are more like those of corporate bonds than those of ordinary shares. **Technically, they may be "equity" investments, but they are not usually considered part of the equity asset class**.

## Equity Subclasses

Equities may be subdivided into the following subclasses:

### Size

There is some evidence that the size of a company influences the risk and return characteristics of its equity securities. Smaller companies appear to generate higher reutrns, although this is accompanied by higher volatility. **Investors distinguish between "large cap" and "small cap" stocks**. **In the US**, where this concept is most developed, **there is also a "mid cap" category**. The figures below show the criteria used by most analysts:

* Large cap: > USD 10 Billion
* Mid cap: USD 2-10 Billion
* Small cap: < USD 2 Billion

### Sector

Different sectors will respond in different ways to changes in the economic cycle. 

**Utilities and food retailers** are example of defensive (noncyclical) investments - they **have an inelastic demand and should perform better in a recession**.

By contrast - cyclical secotrs have a large discretionary component to demand and are thus more likely to suffer in a downturn. Investors can improve the risk/reward profile of their equity portfolios by allocating between weakly-correlated sectors.

**recession** - A recession is a macroeconomic term that refers to a significant decline in general economic activity in a designated region. It had been typically recognized as two consecutive quarters of economic decline, as reflected by GDP in conjunction with monthly indicators such as a rise in unemployment. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), which officially declares recessions, says the two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP are not how it is defined anymore. The NBER defines a recession as a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.

### Region

**Regional subclasses may focus on individual countries** (such as the US) or on regional groupings (such as Europe and Asia-Pacific). A **distinction** is usually **made between developed equity markets** (for example those in the US) **and those of emerging economies**. As markets evolve, further subclasses emerge.

For example, the FTSE/Russle indivies separate emerging market nations into three categories- Advanced, Secondary, and Frontier. **Each category differs with respect to key areas such as regulatory environments, legal framework, and market liquidity**.

**Market** - A market is a place where parties can gather to facilitate the exchange of goods and services. The parties involved are usually buyers and sellers. The market may be physical like a retail outlet, where people meet face-to-face, or virtual like an online market, where there is no direct physical contact between buyers and sellers.

**Stock Exchange** - A stock exchange does not own shares. Instead, it acts as a market where stock buyers connect with stock sellers. Stocks can be traded on several exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the Nasdaq.

**Brokerage** - A brokerage firm or brokerage company is a middleman who connects buyers and sellers to complete a transaction for stock shares, bonds, options, and other financial instruments. Brokers are compensated in commissions or fees that are charged once the transaction has been completed. Most discount brokerages now offer their customers zero-commission stock trading. The companies make up for this loss of revenue from other sources, including payments from the exchanges for large quantities of orders and trading fees for other products like mutual funds and bonds.

**Index** - An index is a method to track the performance of a group of assets in a standardized way. Indexes typically measure the performance of a basket of securities intended to replicate a certain area of the market. These could be a broad-based index that captures the entire market, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index or Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), FTSE,  or more specialized such as indexes that track a particular industry or segment.

**Market Liquidity** - A liquid market a one with many available buyers and sellers and comparatively low transaction costs. The details of what makes a market liquid may vary depending on the asset being exchanged. In a liquid market, it is easy to execute a trade quickly and at a desirable price because there are numerous buyers and sellers and the product being exchanged is standardized and in high demand. In a liquid market despite daily changes in supply and demand the spread between what the buyer wants to pay and what sellers will offer remains relatively small. The opposite of a liquid market is called a "thin market" or an "illiquid market." Thin markets may have considerably large spreads between the highest available buyer and the lowest available seller.

### Growth

Growth stocks are those of **companies where earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate**. **Growth stocks have P/E ratios higher than the market average (assuming they are profitable), and low dividend yields (profits are reinvested rather than distributed)**.

Investors in growth stocks benefit from a momentum effect (strong performance in the psat generates price gains in the future), which can help investors earn better than average returns.


**P/E Ratio** - The price-to-earnings ratio is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS). The price-to-earnings ratio is also sometimes known as the price multiple or the earnings multiple. P/E ratios are used by investors and analysts to determine the relative value of a company's shares in an apples-to-apples comparison. It can also be used to compare a company against its own historical record or to compare aggregate markets against one another or over time. P/E may be estimated on a trailing (backward-looking) or forward (projected) basis.

### Value

A **value stock is perceived to trade at a discount relative to its intrinsic value**. Value stocks **tend to be those of older, more established companies**. **P/E ratios may be lower than average, reflecting low expectations of future growth**.

Value stocks usually exhibit strong fundamental characteristics such as **high dividend yields (higher % of profits go towards dividends)**. The value style of investing can produce better than average returns. A number of studies have also identifies a premium for value stocks, though these studies differ in terms of their definition of vlaue and the size of the premium.

## Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

ETFs are **funds that track a portfolio of a specific index or sector, but are listed, and traded, like stocks on an exchange**. ETFs have **many advantages** for investors **including high liquidity, low transaction costs, and diversification**.
