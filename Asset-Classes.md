# Introduction
**Asset Classes are groups of assets with similar characteristics,
the key asset classes are:**

* Equities
* Bonds
* Cash & cash equivalents
* Real estate
* Alternative assets

## Asset class types

### Equity 
An **equity security** represents **ownership interest in an issuer**, equities can take the form of **common or preferred stock**. E.g. a equity security issued by apple would represent an ownership interest in apple.  

### Bonds

Bonds are mainly **issued by governments, public entities, and coporates**, and typically pay a **fixed or floating rate coupon**. Where the coupon represents the principle on the bond.

### Cash and Cash Equivalents

* Treasury bills - A Treasury Bill (T-Bill) is a short-term U.S. government debt obligation backed by the Treasury Department with a maturity of one year or less. Treasury bills are usually sold in denominations of $1,000. However, some can reach a maximum denomination of $5 million in non-competitive bids. These securities are widely regarded as low-risk and secure investments. The Treasury Department sells T-Bills during auctions using a competitive and non-competitive bidding process. Noncompetitive bids—also known as non-competitive tenders—have a price based on the average of all the competitive bids received. T-Bills tend to have a high tangible net worth.
* CDs (Certificate of Deposit) - A certificate of deposit (CD) is a document issued by the bank to an investor who chooses to deposit his funds in the bank for a specific amount of time. A certificate of deposit can also be referred to as a promissory note issued by a bank. One feature of the CD is that once the money has been deposited for a period of time the depositor cannot withdraw the funds without incurring a penalty for early withdrawal. Since funds cannot be withdrawn as pleased, the interest paid to the depositor of a CD is higher than for a savings account. Once the CD matures, at the end of the specified term of holding the funds are repaid to the depositor alongside the interest calculated for the period. CDs issued by banks can be negotiable or non-negotiable. A negotiable CD allows the holder to sell it on the money market before maturity. A non-negotiable CD mandates the depositor hold the funds till maturity or incur a penalty for early withdrawal.
* CP (Commercial Paper) - Commercial paper is a short term money market instrument that matures within a period of 270 days. Commercial papers are used as a means of raising funds, sometimes used instead of a bank loan, and are usually preferred over a bank loan since large amounts of funds can be raised within a short period of time. Commercial papers are not backed by collateral and, therefore, only creditworthy institutions with high debt ratings can issue them to obtain funds at a lower cost of interest. If the organization does not have a very attractive debt rating they may have to offer a high interest rate that covers investment risk, to attract investors to invest. An advantage to the issuer of a commercial paper is that since the instrument has a very short maturity it does not require a registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which makes it much less complicated and a cheaper form of obtaining finance.

### Real Estate

Real estate can take the form of commercial and residential property. Investors can invest in real estate directly of REITs (Real estate investment trusts). 

* Real estate investment trusts - A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate.
    Modeled after mutual funds, REITs pool the capital of numerous investors. This makes it possible for individual investors to earn dividends from real estate investments—without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves.

### Alternatives

Alternatives include:
* Commodities - A commodity is a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type. Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services. The quality of a given commodity may differ slightly, but it is essentially uniform across producers. When they are traded on an exchange, commodities must also meet specified minimum standards, also known as a basis grade. Examples would be oil, gas, corn, gold.
* Currencies - Currency is a medium of exchange for goods and services. In short, it's money, in the form of paper or coins, usually issued by a government and generally accepted at its face value as a method of payment. Generally currencies are fiat, fiat money is backed by a country's government instead of a physical commodity or financial instrument
* Hedge Funds - Hedge funds are actively managed investment pools whose managers use a wide range of strategies, often including buying with borrowed money and trading esoteric assets, in an effort to beat average investment returns for their clients. They are considered risky alternative investment choices.
* Private Equity - Private equity is an alternative investment class and consists of capital that is not listed on a public exchange. Private equity is composed of funds and investors that directly invest in private companies, or that engage in buyouts of public companies, resulting in the delisting of public equity. Institutional and retail investors provide the capital for private equity, and the capital can be utilized to fund new technology, make acquisitions, expand working capital, and bolster and solidify a balance sheet
* Art & Collectibles - A collectible refers to an item worth far more than it was initially sold for because of its rarity and/or popularity. The price for a particular collectible usually depends on how many of the same items are available and its overall condition.

# Equities

**Equities** are **financial securities** that give holders some degree of **ownership in underlying entities/companies**. There are two main types of equity security: **common stock and preferred stock**.

**Instrument** - An **instrument is a means by which something of value is transferred, held, or accomplished**. In the **field of finance, an instrument is a tradable asset, or a negotiable item, such as a security, commodity, derivative, or index, or any item that underlies a derivative**. In separate contexts, an instrument can alternatively refer to an economic variable that can be controlled or altered by government policymakers to effect a change in other economic indicators. It can also refer to a legal document such as a contract, will, or deed.

**Security** - The term **"security" refers to a fungible (can be mutually interchanged), negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value. It represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded corporation via stock; a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation represented by owning that entity's bond; or rights to ownership as represented by an option**.

## Common Stock

Most equities take the form of **common stock (or "ordinary shares") that give owners some degree of ownership in a company**. **Common stock grants shareholders voting rights at AGMs - different classes of common stock may carry different voting rights**. Shareholders may have pre-emption rights whereby a company cannot issue shares to new shareholders without offering them first to existing shareholders. 

The underlying health of a company will dictate the value of a share - if the company is profitable, then shareholders benefit from either cash dividends or capital appreciation. If the company fares poorly, it may be unable to pay a dividend. **Note that dividends are arbitrary rather than mandatory - company management may decide to retain earninings in the company (even where it is profitable) rather than pay dividends to common stockholders**. **Dividend policies vary radically across the world's largest companies**. **In the case of company bankruptcy, equity holders are the last in line to receive any liquidation proceeds** - they usually receive nothing.

**Bankruptcy** - **Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding involving a person or business that is unable to repay their outstanding debts**. The bankruptcy **process begins with a petition filed by the debtor, which is most common, or on behalf of creditors, which is less common**. All of the **debtor's assets are measured and evaluated**, and the **assets may be used to repay a portion of the outstanding debt**.

## Preferred Stock

Companies sometimes issue securities known as **preferred stock** (or preference shares). Preferred stock carries a **fixed dividend that must be paid to preferred stockholders before ordinary shareholders receive anything**. It represents a "middle layer" in the capital structure of an organization (between debt and equity). **In the event of liquidation, preferred stockholders receive any residual value ahead of ordinary shareholders, but after bondholders or bank creditors**.

The investment characteristics of preferred stock are more like those of corporate bonds than those of ordinary shares. **Technically, they may be "equity" investments, but they are not usually considered part of the equity asset class**.

## Equity Subclasses

Equities may be subdivided into the following subclasses:

### Size

There is some evidence that the size of a company influences the risk and return characteristics of its equity securities. Smaller companies appear to generate higher reutrns, although this is accompanied by higher volatility. **Investors distinguish between "large cap" and "small cap" stocks**. **In the US**, where this concept is most developed, **there is also a "mid cap" category**. The figures below show the criteria used by most analysts:

* Large cap: > USD 10 Billion
* Mid cap: USD 2-10 Billion
* Small cap: < USD 2 Billion

### Sector

Different sectors will respond in different ways to changes in the economic cycle. 

**Utilities and food retailers** are example of defensive (noncyclical) investments - they **have an inelastic demand and should perform better in a recession**.

By contrast - cyclical secotrs have a large discretionary component to demand and are thus more likely to suffer in a downturn. Investors can improve the risk/reward profile of their equity portfolios by allocating between weakly-correlated sectors.

**recession** - A recession is a macroeconomic term that refers to a significant decline in general economic activity in a designated region. It had been typically recognized as two consecutive quarters of economic decline, as reflected by GDP in conjunction with monthly indicators such as a rise in unemployment. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), which officially declares recessions, says the two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP are not how it is defined anymore. The NBER defines a recession as a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.

### Region

**Regional subclasses may focus on individual countries** (such as the US) or on regional groupings (such as Europe and Asia-Pacific). A **distinction** is usually **made between developed equity markets** (for example those in the US) **and those of emerging economies**. As markets evolve, further subclasses emerge.

For example, the FTSE/Russle indivies separate emerging market nations into three categories- Advanced, Secondary, and Frontier. **Each category differs with respect to key areas such as regulatory environments, legal framework, and market liquidity**.

**Market** - A market is a place where parties can gather to facilitate the exchange of goods and services. The parties involved are usually buyers and sellers. The market may be physical like a retail outlet, where people meet face-to-face, or virtual like an online market, where there is no direct physical contact between buyers and sellers.

**Stock Exchange** - A stock exchange does not own shares. Instead, it acts as a market where stock buyers connect with stock sellers. Stocks can be traded on several exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the Nasdaq.

**Brokerage** - A brokerage firm or brokerage company is a middleman who connects buyers and sellers to complete a transaction for stock shares, bonds, options, and other financial instruments. Brokers are compensated in commissions or fees that are charged once the transaction has been completed. Most discount brokerages now offer their customers zero-commission stock trading. The companies make up for this loss of revenue from other sources, including payments from the exchanges for large quantities of orders and trading fees for other products like mutual funds and bonds.

**Index** - An index is a method to track the performance of a group of assets in a standardized way. Indexes typically measure the performance of a basket of securities intended to replicate a certain area of the market. These could be a broad-based index that captures the entire market, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index or Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), FTSE,  or more specialized such as indexes that track a particular industry or segment.

**Market Liquidity** - A liquid market a one with many available buyers and sellers and comparatively low transaction costs. The details of what makes a market liquid may vary depending on the asset being exchanged. In a liquid market, it is easy to execute a trade quickly and at a desirable price because there are numerous buyers and sellers and the product being exchanged is standardized and in high demand. In a liquid market despite daily changes in supply and demand the spread between what the buyer wants to pay and what sellers will offer remains relatively small. The opposite of a liquid market is called a "thin market" or an "illiquid market." Thin markets may have considerably large spreads between the highest available buyer and the lowest available seller.

### Growth

Growth stocks are those of **companies where earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate**. **Growth stocks have P/E ratios higher than the market average (assuming they are profitable), and low dividend yields (profits are reinvested rather than distributed)**.

Investors in growth stocks benefit from a momentum effect (strong performance in the psat generates price gains in the future), which can help investors earn better than average returns.


**P/E Ratio** - The price-to-earnings ratio is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS). The price-to-earnings ratio is also sometimes known as the price multiple or the earnings multiple. P/E ratios are used by investors and analysts to determine the relative value of a company's shares in an apples-to-apples comparison. It can also be used to compare a company against its own historical record or to compare aggregate markets against one another or over time. P/E may be estimated on a trailing (backward-looking) or forward (projected) basis.

### Value

A **value stock is perceived to trade at a discount relative to its intrinsic value**. Value stocks **tend to be those of older, more established companies**. **P/E ratios may be lower than average, reflecting low expectations of future growth**.

Value stocks usually exhibit strong fundamental characteristics such as **high dividend yields (higher % of profits go towards dividends)**. The value style of investing can produce better than average returns. A number of studies have also identifies a premium for value stocks, though these studies differ in terms of their definition of vlaue and the size of the premium.

## Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

ETFs are **funds that track a portfolio of a specific index or sector, but are listed, and traded, like stocks on an exchange**. ETFs have **many advantages** for investors **including high liquidity, low transaction costs, and diversification**. 

Though many **ETFs invest in traditional assets**, a **considerable number also invest in alternative assets such as currencies and commodities (ETCs)**.

## Equity Size & Value

The **simplest versions of CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) rely soley on market risk (beta) when explaining differences in expected equity returns**. **Higher risk should generate higher expected rewards. However, empirical research suggests that high beta stocks do not outperform the way expected**. 

In 1993, Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French suggested a three factory model that incorporated two additional risk factors: **size and value**. Their long term studies of US equity returns suggested that smaller firms (as measured by market capitalization: number of outstanding shares * price per share) outpeformed larger ones, while value firms (as measured by price-to-book value) outperformed growth firms.

Why should this happen? Some experts (including Fama and French themselves) suggest that excess returns are a rational response to additional risks (for example leverage, volatility, and higher costs of capital) associated with value and/or smaller firms. By contrast, behavioural explanations associate the excess returns with irrational mispricing of economic fundamentals and/or overreactions to previous weakness.

These excess returns are accompanied with higher volatility- size and value portfolios have annualized standard deviations approximately 5-7% higher than market averagers. Portfolios based on either style may go through significant periods of underpeformance relative to the overall market. The idea that multiple risk factors generate excess returns (and the associated concept of factor investment) is now widely accepted amongst investment experts. Analysts debate the merits of other potential sources of excess return, such as momentum and low volatility. 

In 2015, Fama and French introduced a new five-factor model which added two new elements - profitability (higher opreating profibility boosts returns) and investment (high asset growth depresses returns). However, the five-factory model is less admired than its pioneering predecessor (market risk, size & value).

**Outstanding shares** - Shares outstanding refer to a company's stock currently held by all its shareholders. These include share blocks held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the company’s officers and insiders. A company's number of shares outstanding is not static and may fluctuate wildly over time.

**Leverage** - Leverage results from using borrowed capital as a funding source when investing to expand the firm's asset base and generate returns on risk capital. Leverage is an investment strategy of using borrowed money—specifically, the use of various financial instruments or borrowed capital—to increase the potential return of an investment.

**Market risk** - Market risk is the possibility that an individual or other entity will experience losses due to factors that affect the overall performance of investments in the financial markets. Market risk and specific risk (unsystematic) make up the two major categories of investment risk. Market risk, also called "systematic risk," cannot be eliminated through diversification, though it can be hedged in other ways. Sources of market risk include recessions, political turmoil, changes in interest rates, natural disasters, and terrorist attacks. Systematic, or market risk, tends to influence the entire market at the same time. This can be contrasted with unsystematic risk, which is unique to a specific company or industry. Also known as “nonsystematic risk,” "specific risk," "diversifiable risk" or "residual risk," in the context of an investment portfolio, unsystematic risk can be reduced through diversification.

**Volatility** - Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security. Volatility is often measured as either the standard deviation or variance between returns from that same security or market index.

**Momentum** - Momentum is the rate of acceleration of a security's price—that is, the speed at which the price is changing. Momentum trading is a strategy that seeks to capitalize on momentum to enter a trend as it is picking up steam. Simply put, momentum refers to the inertia of a price trend to continue either rising or falling for a particular length of time, usually taking into account both price and volume information. In technical analysis, momentum is often measured via an oscillator and is used to help identify trends.

**Cost of Capital** - Cost of capital is a company's calculation of the minimum return that would be necessary in order to justify undertaking a capital budgeting project, such as building a new factory. The term cost of capital is used by analysts and investors, but it is always an evaluation of whether a projected decision can be justified by its cost. Investors may also use the term to refer to an evaluation of an investment's potential return in relation to its cost and its risks. Many companies use a combination of debt and equity to finance business expansion. For such companies, the overall cost of capital is derived from the weighted average cost of all capital sources. This is known as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

## Private Equity (PE)/Venture Capital (VC)

Not all shares are traded on public markets. Some companies raise equity (equity financing is the process of raising capital through the sale of shares) privately from sophisticated insitutional investors and accredited funds. Investments may be in existing businesses (often accompanied by coporate reoraganizations), or may represent seed capital (ventur capital) for new or growing organizations. These **private investments are monetized if/when a company goes public**. This process may take many years. 

The distinctive nature of PE investments means that many experts consider it to be a separate asset class. However, most PE investors take an active role in the management of the underlying companies. It is not obvious that passively-held PE generates any form of "natural" return (or beta). The success (or otherwise) is bound up with the abilities of the investors.

## Equity Returns & Volatility

While equity markets have suffered a number of severe blows in recent decades (ranging from the dotcom crash of the early part of the century to the declines of the global financial crisis), equities **still offer potentially good returns over the long-term. In fact, equities are perhaps the generator of above inflation returns in the long run and their hisotrical performance compares very favorable with that of other asset classes**.

Counterbalancing the attractiveness of potentially higher long-term returns is the fact that equities **can also be very risky investment. This volatility exists because the historical performance of companies is not necessarily a good predictor of future performance**. 

**Market participants have different views on a company's future profitability - this causes volaitlity as different investors trade on different expectations. Volatility also takes account of other factors, such as underlying macroeconomic risks that manifest themselves in the earnings and cash flows of firms in that economy.**

## Equity Risk Premium (ERP)

Because equity markets are volatile, investors will demand a risk premium for investing in this asset class. This premium measures the incremental return that **investors require for holding equities rather than risk free securities such as treasury bills/bonds**. **The risk premium is important as it is the key determinant of the cost of capital, it determines current valuations, and it drives future expected returns**.

The standard approach to estimating equity risk premiums involves the use of historical returns, with the difference in annualised returns on stocks and bills/bonds over a long time period comprising the expected risk premium in the future. Since 1900, the ERP in the US has been estimated at 5.5% relative to short-term bills and 4.3% relative to government bonds. Similar figures for global equity markets are 4.2% and 3.2% respectively.

## Forecasting ERP

Although many ERP forecasts extrapolate from hisotric values, many analysts **prefer forecasts based on current market levels**. **Calculations usually split equity returns into growth and income components**.

For example, given a constant P/E ratio, the combination of dividend yield (DY) and dividend growth (g) generates basic "real" returns (income plus capital). Adding inflation gives the normal return. **Analysts can forecast future values and returns using observed values of dividend yield and forecast values for growth**.

The implied ERP can be calculated using some form of dividend discount model (DDM). Although details differ, all DDMs assume that the present value of a share is equal to the discounted future value of all future dividends. 

The most popular DDM model, the Gordon growth model, assumes that the **current value of a share is explained by the current dividend, a market discount rate(r), and a constant dividend growth (g). It has the following formula**:

**P = D / (r - g)**

**r = D/P + g**

Dividend/price is simply the dividend yield (DY), **so r = DY + g**. The discount rate r can be decomposed into the riskless government bond yield (y) + the equity risk premium (ERP).

**DY + g = y + ERP**

**ERP = DY + g - y**

### Forecasting ERP: Issues

The simplicity of this methodology is deceptive. There is plenty of disagreement around specific calculations, particularly as regards valuation of the long-term growth rate. Analysts differ as to weather to use dividend data, earnings data, or GDP growth rates. If derives ERP is significantly different from historical averages, this could indicate:

* An under or overvalued market, and/or
* A long-term change in investors' risk perceptions

An alternative is to base ERP forecasts around survey data. These surveys aggregate ERP estimates from experts such as academics, investors, or corporate finance professionals. However, the quality of the responses will vary, and measurements typically exhibit high levels of volatility.

# Fixed Income

## What is Fixed Income?

"Fixed Income" describes the whole universe of long-dated debt securities (bonds). Investors generally receive more stable returns on bonds than they do on equities, since interest payments do not vary with the specific performance of the issuer. However, the term "fixed income" is misleading. **Not all bonds have fixed coupon. and the income is only "fixed" so long as the borrower does not default**.

Duration risk applies to standard fixed rate bonds due to the inverse relationship between yield and price (as yields, prices fall, and vice versa). As bond duration increases, bond prices are more sensitive to yield changes. Furthermore, inflation erodes the real value of fixed returns. These impacts are reduced where bonds are inflation-linked or have variable coupons.

**Duration Risk** - Duration risk is the risk associated with the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in interest rates.

## Bond Issuers

Bond market issuers vary markedly in terms of type and geographic location. The wide variety of potential debt instruments means that most borrowers are in some way involved in the bond markets. Key issuers include:

### Governments
 Government Securities (especially those denominated in the domestic currency) represent the bedrock of most developed bond markets. Government bonds issued in the domestic currency **are effectively default-free - the government can always choose to print money to satisfy local currency obligations**.

Government securities are considered by many to be riskless. For any particular maturity, local currency government bond yields are typically regarded as default-free benchmarks.

However, government bonds are impacted by duration risk, and foreign investors must take account of foreign exchange risk. Nevertheless, some government bonds (such as TIPs) are inflation-linked; the yields on these bonds represent real returns.

Where there is no well-developed local capital market, governments raise funds by issuing bonds denominated in foreign currencies (particullaryly USD and EUR) on international markets.

### Other Public Entities

Local governments, public utilities, and supranational orfanizations issue bonds both internationally and on domestic markets. In the US domestic market, tax-exempt bonds are issued by state and local government entities. These bonds are not default free, that is, they are not guaranteed by the US government.

### Corporates

The broad category of private corporate bond issuance is usually divided between high-quality investment grade (IG) borrowers and more speculative high yield (HY) borrowers. The price of a HY bond is usually sensitive to changes in credit perceptions than to changes in interest rates.

### Securitizaitons

In a securitization, a special-purpose company issues a bond where interest payments are generated by an underlying collateral pool of assets. These are significant differences between the credit qualities of particular classes of bond.

## Bond Issuers: Sectors

Issuers can be grouped together according to domicile or industry.

Historically, some borrowers have borrowed debt at different prices by issuing in multiple markets (for examlpe, domestic and international markets), and each of these markets represent a separate subclass.

However, regulatory changes have eradicted many of the difference between trading markets, and price differentials have fallen.

## Bond Issuers: Private Issuance

As with equities, some expert investors purchase bonds that are not tradable on conventional markets through private placements. These securities may be exempt from some domestic market restrictions, thus allowing the issuance of customised transactions with non-standard terms and covenants. This apporach is particularly suited to smaller HY issuers.

## Features of Bonds

Some other key features of bonds include:

### Coupon

Some bonds have variable rather than fixed coupons. In most cases, coupon rates reset every three or six months, reflecting any changes in short-term rates. Duration risk is often negligible, but investors must still take account of credit risk. By contrast, zero coupon bonds have no interim payments. The bond price is the discounted value of the principal. Duration risk for a zero-coupon bond is higher than for fixed coupon bonds of similar maturity.

### Maturity

Bonds can be grouped according to their final maturity:

* Short-dated bonds: less than 3 years
* Medium-term bonds: 4-10 years
* Lond-dated bonds: more than 10 years

Some perpetual ("undated") bonds have no maturity - these bonds must be valued by discounting the appropriate annuity stream. Note it may be misleading toe classify bonds by maturity if they have **embeded options**. Call options (associated with many high yield corporate bonds) allow the isseur to redeem bonds before a final maturity date, while put provisions give an early redemption option to the bondholder.

## Loans

Bank loans are not securities and traditionally they have not been considered as part of an investable asset class. However, nonbank investors are becoming increasingly active in the loans market, either through direct transactions or by purchasing loan funds or securitizations. High yield leveraged loans are particularly popular, and returns and correlations are similar to those of high yield bonds.

## Bond Risk Premium (BRP)

Bond risk premium is the **difference between the expected yield on a risky bond and the yield on a risk-free bond of similar maturity and coupon rate**. Let's look at how the BRP arises.

Consider an ivnestor choosing between two default-free government debt instruments, a short-term bill and a fixed-rate long-term bond. If the interest income on both is the same, then a risk-neutral lender should be indifferent between:

* Investing in a long-dated instrument
* "Rolling over" a succession of short-dated bills

The yield on the long-dated bond would be equivalent to the average short-term interest rate expected over its life. Over long observation periods (assuming similar episodes of both rising and falling rates) returns on bills should be the same as those on bonds. However, empirical evidence shows that bond investments have historically outperformed bills (short-term).

Furthermore, most yield curves are positive, that is, long-term rates are higher than short-term rates. In a risk-neutral world, higher long-term rates reflect expectations of short-term rate rises. This suggests that investors are predicting rising rates most of the time - this is not an equillibrium state over a whole business cycle.

We can explain the historical observations of both excess returns and positive yiedl curves if we assume that investors are in fact risk-averse and require some compensation - in the form of BRP - for "locking up" asstes and taking duration risk. A government bond yield can be considered a combination of rate expections and BRP.

## Bond Risk Premium (BRP): Calculation
A positive BRP generates a positive yield curve even when no rate rises are forecast. If we combine current bond yields with interest rate forecasts, it is possible to infer the BRP.

For example, if a ten-year bond currently has a yield of 4%, and analysts expect future rates to average 3%, then the BRP will be 1%. Although historic evidence suggests that BRPs are usually positive, if bond prices rise too much (and yields fall too much) then a BRP inferred from current levels may be negative.

Although there is some relationship between observed excess returns and volatility, it is not as simple as saying that longer duration means a higher premium. For example, investors in medium-term US Treasuries historically received higher excess returns than those who owned longer-dated assets, despite lower volatility.

## Credit Risk Premium (CRP)

Credit spreads represent the excess return of a risky instrument over a default-free government alternative. In a risk-neutral universe, the spread would simply equal expected loss (EL), which is equal to probability of default (PD) times loss given default (LGD).

**Credit Spread = EL = PD x LGD**

After removing credit losses, returns on risky bonds should equal those on riskless government bonds. However, studies of US corporate bonds suggest that post-default returns exceed those of government bonds. Rough estimates of post-default excess return in the US corporate bond market range from 0.25-0.50% per annum. The credit spread should include this excess return, or credit risk premium:

**Credit Spread = EL + CRP**

Empirical research suggests that the "gross" CRP can be broken down into a number of constituent parts, though there is disagreement surrounding the importance of each component

In some jurisdictions, part of the premium may be due to differential tax treatment between government and corporate bonds. Corporate bonds may also attract a risk premium due to illiquidity. Finally, default risk is not fully diversifiable (bond defaults tend to "cluster” together). Investors may require compensation for this systematic risk.

### Correlation with Equities

Since default rates are associated with the same economic drivers as those for equities, it is no surprise both that risky bonds are positively correlated with equities, and that this correlation increases with credit risk. Studies have shown that the weakest credits (HY bonds) have a high correlation with the equity market and a negative correlation with treasuries.

# Cash & Cash Alternatives

## Overview of Cash & Cash Alternatives

Physical cash holdings represent the extreme end of the investment spectrum. As long as it is safe from theft, cash does not decline in nominal terms. However, inflation reduced the real value of cash worldwide by around 4% per annum during the period 1900-2014 (Source: Credit Suisse).
Investors can boost returns somewhat through low-risk alternatives such as savings accounts or short-term debt investments, but returns remain poor compared with longer-term investments.
Over the long term, the average portfolio cannot afford to invest the majority of its funds in these instruments. However, there is generally some allocation to easily accessible, low-risk investments that can be liquidated at short notice. This "dry powder" allows investors to respond to short-term opportunities or cover unforeseen liabilities.

## Types of Cash Investment

### Government Bills

Government bills (short-term debt securities) are the preferred low-risk cash market choice for many investors. As well as being virtually default-free, most major bill markets are highly liquid. Global historic real returns on bills have been mildly positive (around 1% per annum for the period 1900-2015).

### Certificates of Deposit (CDs)

A CD is a debt security issued by a financial institution (usually a bank) similar to a time deposit. Although CDs can have maturity of up to five years, the majority are for less than six months. Outside of the US, high-denomination CDs are traded wholesale between financial institutions, although markets are not usually as liquid as those for bills. US CDs are effectively long-term savings accounts designed for retail investors - CDs are government-insured, and there is little secondary market trading. Nevertheless, CD rates are still higher (roughly 0.2-0.3%) than those for bills.

### Commercial Paper (CP)

CP is a generic term for negotiable short-term debt instruments issued by private entities. Originally, the term referred to nonfinancial US corporate issuance, but today CP is issued across the globe by both financial and nonfinancial borrowers. CP is usually unsecured, with maturities varying from one day to a year.

There is limited liquidity in the CP market, and many investors hold to maturity. The return differential between CP and bills varies between markets and maturities. For example, the excess return of Us three-month CP over three-month US Treasury bills has generally been between 0.20-6.30%. However, at the height of the financial crisis this gap widened to over 2.5%.

### Money Market Funds (MMFS)

Investors can purchase short-term securities indirectly by investing in a money market fund (MMF). An MMF is a type of open-ended mutual fund that purchases the money market securities, such as Treasury bills, CD, and CP. Many brokerages automatically place ("sweep") investors' surplus cash into MMFS. By investing in risky assets, MMFS provide higher yields than bank deposits, but there is no government insurance. During the financial crisis. the net asset value of some funds fell below the principal invested (in market jargon, these funds "broke the buck"). This highlighted the fact that MMFS are low risk rather than no risk.

# Real Estate

## Overview of Real Estate

Real estate (or property makes up around 10% of global assets under management. In terms of risks and return, this asset class seems to lie somewhere between equity and fixed income. However, the heterogeneous and opaque nature of real estate investments makes precise measurement difficult.

Most real estate investment is in commercial property such as office buildings or shopping malls, although there are also some large-scale investments in residential property. Returns are a combination of income (mainly rents) and capital gains/losses.

Although popular perceptions of property markets are linked to dramatic changes in capital values (bubbles or crashes), there is no long-term evidence of real capital appreciation. However, nominal values tend to keep pace with inflation. While they must be wary of medium-term capital trends, long-term investors focus on potential rental yields.

## Real Estate Invesment

Direct ownership is the most straightforward method of private investment in real estate. However, such investments are comparatively illiquid. The property market is "lumpy" in that transactions are occasional rather than continuous, with each one separately negotiated. Investments will usually require significant outlay of capital, so diversification is only available to very large investors. Unlike securities, real estate cannot be stored or transported, and investors cannot "go short." Instead of transparent price information, investors rely on periodic, subjective appraisals. Since sole ownership often involves active management of the underlying asset, investors may instead form property clubs/syndicates that delegate management while remaining responsible for asset selection.

Over three quarters of all real estate investment is via real estate investment trusts (REITS). A REIT is a restricted property-owning company that distributes all (or most of its income as dividends. REITS do not usually pay corporate tax because stockholders pay income tax on the distributions. Most REITs are publicly listed, although there are some private structures. While REITs, or their equivalents, are found across the globe, us vehicles account for just over half of global market capitalization. Investors also purchase shares in non-REIT listed property companies or funds.

Since the property market is largely immune to arbitrage, there are significant variations in the performance of real estate both between and within different countries. This lack of correlation encourages diversification, although most investment managers exhibit a strong home bias. There are significant difficulties associated with calculating the historic investment performance of real estate. There is a notable lack of data outside of the us, and measurements through price appraisals tend to understate volatility. In terms of correlations with other asset classes, studies suggest that direct real estate investments have negligible correlation (if any) with bonds and are only weakly correlated with equities. Public investments (REITS) have a significant positive correlation with equities and are negatively correlated with bonds.

# Alternative Assets

## Overview of Alternative Assets

Alternative assets (or alternative investments) are assets that are not mainstream ("traditional") assets like debt and equity. Key characteristics of alternative assets include:

* A limited investment history 
* An illiquid (or nonexistent) secondary market 
* Different performance characteristics to traditional assets 
* Requirement for specialist skills on the part of the asset manager

By contrast, traditional assets are typically traded in liquid public markets and are managed by mainstream strategies.

Alternative assets offer investors the benefits of diversification and potentially higher returns. Their relative illiquidity makes them suitable as a long-term investment. Against this, alternative assets may be hard to value and expensive to trade.

Next let's look at the key types of alternative asset.

## Types of Alternative Assets

### Commodities

Commodities are raw or partly refined materials traded for processing into final goods. Examples of commodities include grains, meat, metals, oil, and gas. Most commodities are consumed or transformed into other products, though some commodities like gold (and other precious metals) can act as a store of value especially in times of economic uncertainty.

The value of a particular commodity is dependent upon global supply and demand. Consequently, commodity prices are determined globally rather than regionally. Most commodities are exchange-traded and are for future delivery. Returns on commodity futures are derived from the price performance of the commodity in the cash market, rolling near-dated contracts forward into far-dated contracts, and interest earned on excess margin collateral.

One of the main benefits of investing in a commodity is that it both diversifies an investment portfolio and acts as a countercyclical asset. Commodity prices have a low or even negative correlation with the prices of capital assets, such as stocks and bonds. Commodities also have a low correlation with each other as they are subject to different economic influences. However, commodities are often illiquid assets that exhibit short-term price swings. Commodity prices may also move in line with producer and consumer prices during periods of inflation but not in periods of deflation.

### Currencies

Foreign currency is an increasingly popular asset class for investors. The main attraction of this asset is its low correlation with bond or equity market returns. Investing in currencies can thus be a useful tool in diversifying an investment portfolio. Currencies are also income-producing assets, as investors can earn interest on foreign currency deposits.

### Hedge Funds

A hedge fund is a pooled investment vehicle that is privately organized, administered by professional investment managers, and not widely available to the public. A hedge fund will typically:

* Have an absolute return performance objective (outlined in the fund's prospectus), 
* Grant the fund manager significant flexibility in investment style, including the use of derivatives and leverage, and the ability to take long and short positions in the market 
* Reward the manager with performance-based fees 
* Involve significant trading activity and adjustment of positions

Hedge funds attract talented and motivated fund managers and may thus offer superior risk-adjusted returns. Hedge fund returns have historically displayed a low correlation with equity and bond markets as well as with each other.

### Private Equity

Private equity is a form of equity not freely tradable on a public stock exchange. It is used by investors looking to start up, expand, or purchase a stake in a business. The two main strategies for private equity investing are venture capital and leveraged buy-outs.

Most private equity investments are financed and managed by the general managers of investment partnerships. These then sell their stakes after their investment goals have been achieved.

### Structured Products

Structured products are debt instruments where the return is in the form of an embedded derivative payout. They tend to have a specified maturity, automatically generate return, and are usually cash-settled. A typical structured product will consist of some combination of participation, downside protection, and capped return.

For investors, structured products offer the benefits of customization and diversification, though liquidity may be limited. There is also credit risk on the issuer of the instrument, as well as potential credit risk as regards components referenced in the instrument.

### Art & Other Collectibles

Collecting works of art, fine wines, jewelry, and so on, has historically been seen as the preserve of the connoisseur, but increasingly it is being used as an investment. Collectibles are seen as a store of value due to their permanence, portability, and rarity value.

Costs and risks of investing in art and other collectibles include market illiquidity, lack of price transparency, and high storage and insurance costs.

## Alternative vs Mainstream Assets

There is some controversy as to what constitutes a mainstream asset and what may be classified as an alternative asset. For example, some regard real estate to be a mainstream asset; others will categorize it as an alternative asset.

While many consider alternative assets to be separate asset classes, others consider them to be subclasses of traditional asset classes. For example, private equity is considered by many to be a separate asset class, but others would treat it as a subclass of the equities class. In this tutorial we will consider them to be separate asset classes.

Although we have chosen to classify hedge funds as alternative assets, these funds invest largely in mainstream assets. However, the strategies employed by hedge funds are nontraditional and thus they can be can be viewed as alternative strategies.
